# Data Structure & Algorithm

## Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) in C

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Dynamic Memory Allocation** in C using the standard library functions: `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`.

---

### 📌 Overview

Dynamic Memory Allocation allows programs to request memory **at runtime**, rather than using fixed memory at compile-time. This is useful when the size of data structures (like arrays) is not known beforehand or may change during execution.

---

### 🎯 Key Functions

#### 1. `malloc()`
- **Purpose:** Allocates a specified number of bytes in memory.
- **Syntax:**  
  ```c
  ptr = (datatype*) malloc(size_in_bytes);
  ```
- **Behavior:**
    - Allocates uninitialized memory
    - Garbage values may be present
    - Returns `NULL` if memory allocation fails

#### 2. `calloc()`
- **Purpose:** Allocates memory for multiple elements and initializes all bytes to zero.
- **Syntax:**
```c
ptr = (datatype *)calloc(number_of_elements, sizeof(datatype));
```
- **Behavior:**
    - Allocates memory for an array
    - Initializes all elements to 0
    - Returns `NULL` if memory allocation fails

#### 3. `realloc()`
- **Purpose:** Resizes previously allocated memory.
- **Syntax:**
```c
ptr = (datatype *)realloc(ptr, new_size_in_bytes);
```
- **Behavior:**
    - Preserves existing data
    - May move memory to a new location
    - Newly allocated memory is not initialized
    - Returns NULL if reallocation fails

#### 4. `free()`
- **Purpose:** Releases dynamically allocated memory back to the system.
- **Syntax:**
```c
free(ptr);
```
- **Behavior:**
    - Frees memory allocated using malloc(), calloc(), or realloc()
    - Prevents memory leaks
    - Pointer should not be used after freeing

## Stack Implementation Using Array

### 📌 Overview

This section demonstrates the **implementation of a Stack using an Array** and explains the **basic stack operations**.  
A stack is a **linear data structure** that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle, meaning the last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- To understand the concept of a **stack data structure**
- To implement a stack using an **array**
- To perform common stack operations such as:
  - Push
  - Pop
  - Display
- To understand **stack overflow** and **stack underflow**

---

### 🧠 Stack Concepts

#### 🔹 Stack
A stack is a linear data structure where:
- Insertion and deletion occur only at **one end**, called the **top**
- It follows the **LIFO** rule

#### 🔹 Array-Based Stack
- Uses an array to store stack elements
- Has a fixed size defined at compile time
- Efficient for simple stack operations

---

### ⁉️ Why Use struct for Stack?
- Groups stack data (array and top) into a single unit
- Improves readability and organization
- Allows creation of multiple stack objects
- Represents stack as an Abstract Data Type (ADT)

---

### ⁉️ Why Use typedef?
- Simplifies structure usage
- Avoids repeated use of struct keyword
- Makes code cleaner and more readable

---

### ⁉️ Why Use Pointer in Stack Functions?

- Stack operations modify the original stack, so functions receive the stack using a pointer.
- Example:
```c
void push(Stack *s);
```
- Prevents creation of copies
- Ensures real-time updates to top and stack data

---

### 📝 Explanation of Important Syntax
1. `push(&s)`
    - Passes the address of stack
    - Required because function expects a pointer

2. `Stack *s`
    - Receives address of stack
    - Allows direct modification of stack data

3. `s->top`
    - Used to access structure members via pointer
    - Equivalent to (*s).top

---

### 🤓 Stack Display Logic
- Only elements from index 0 to top are valid.
- Correct display loop:
```c
for (i = s->top; i >= 0; i--) {
    printf("%d ", s->stack[i]);
}
```
- ❌ Looping till MAX may display garbage values

---

### 🔧 Stack Operations

#### 1️⃣ Push Operation
- Adds an element to the **top of the stack**
- Before pushing, it checks for **stack overflow**
- Overflow occurs when `top == size - 1`

**Condition Checked:**
If stack is full → Overflow
Else → Increment top and insert element

---

#### 2️⃣ Pop Operation
- Removes the **topmost element** from the stack
- Before popping, it checks for **stack underflow**
- Underflow occurs when `top == -1`

**Condition Checked:**
If stack is empty → Underflow
Else → Remove element and decrement top

---

#### 3️⃣ Peek Operation
- Displays the **top element** of the stack without removing it
- Useful to check the current element at the top

---

#### 4️⃣ Display Operation
- Displays all elements of the stack
- Elements are shown from **top to bottom**
- Helps visualize the stack structure

---

### 🧠 Algorithm: Array Implementation of Stack

5. If choice = 1, perform push()
    - Else if choice = 2, perform pop()
    - Else if choice = 3, perform display()
    - Else if choice = 4, terminate the program
    - Else display “Invalid input”
6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until choice = 4
7. Stop

    #### Algorithm: push() Operation

8. Check stack overflow
    - If top == MAX − 1, display “Stack is Full” and return
9. Read element
    - Input the element to be pushed
10. Insert element
    - Increment top
    - Store element at stack[top]
11. Return to main menu

    #### Algorithm: pop() Operation

12. Check stack underflow
    - If top == −1, display “Stack is Empty” and return
13. Remove element
    - Store stack[top] in a variable
    - Decrement top
13. Display popped element
13. Return to main menu

    #### Algorithm: display() Operation

14. Check if stack is empty
    - If top == −1, display “Stack is Empty” and return
14. Display stack elements
    - Print elements from index 0 to top
14. Return to main menu

---

### ⚠️ Stack Conditions

#### 🚫 Stack Overflow
Occurs when trying to push an element into a **full stack**.

#### 🚫 Stack Underflow
Occurs when trying to pop an element from an **empty stack**.

---

### 🏗️ Program Flow
1. Initialize stack and set `top = -1`
2. Display a menu for stack operations
3. Perform operation based on user choice
4. Repeat until the user exits

## Postfix Expression Evaluation

### 📌 Objective

The objective of this program is to evaluate a postfix (Reverse Polish) expression using the stack data structure. The program demonstrates how stacks are effectively used to process expressions where operators follow operands, eliminating the need for parentheses and operator precedence rules.

---

### 📌 Introduction

In computer science, expressions can be represented in three forms:
- Infix (e.g., A + B)
- Prefix (e.g., + A B)
- Postfix (e.g., A B +)

Postfix expressions are especially useful for computation because they can be evaluated from left to right using a stack, making them simple and efficient for machines to process.

---

### 🧠 Core Concepts

1️⃣ Stack Data Structure
- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- Basic stack operations include:
    - Push: Insert an element onto the stack
    - Pop: Remove the top element from the stack
- Stacks are ideal for postfix evaluation because operands can be stored temporarily until an operator is encountered.

2️⃣ Postfix Expression
- A postfix expression places operators after their operands.
- Example:
    - Infix: 3 + 4
    - Postfix: 34+
- Characteristics:
    - No parentheses required
    - No need to consider operator precedence
    - Evaluated strictly from left to right

3️⃣ Operand and Operator Handling
- Operands (numbers) are pushed onto the stack.
- Operators trigger the removal (pop) of the top two operands from the stack.
- The operation is performed and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

---

### 🧠 Working Principle
- Initialize an empty stack.
- Scan the postfix expression from left to right.
- If the scanned symbol is an operand, push it onto the stack.
- If the scanned symbol is an operator:
    - Pop the top two operands from the stack.
    - Apply the operator to these operands.
    - Push the result back onto the stack.
- After the entire expression is processed, the stack contains a single value.
- This value is the final result of the postfix expression.

---

### 🧠 Algorithm: Evaluation of Postfix Expression Using Stack

    - Define an integer stack with array data[MAX]
    -Initialize top = -1
3. Read postfix expression
    - Input the postfix expression as a string
4. Scan postfix expression from left to right
5. If character is an operand
    - Convert character to integer
    - Push the value onto the stack
6. If character is an operator
    - Pop the top element as op2
    - Pop the next element as op1
    - Perform the operation op1 operator op2
    - Push the result onto the stack
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until end of expression
8. Pop final result

## Prefix Expression Evaluation

### 📌 Objective

The objective of this program is to evaluate a prefix (Polish) expression using the stack data structure. The program highlights how prefix expressions can be efficiently evaluated by reversing the expression and applying stack-based computation.

---

### ✨ Introduction

Arithmetic expressions can be written in three notations:
- Infix → A + B
- Prefix → + A B
- Postfix → A B +
In prefix notation, the operator appears before its operands. This notation is widely used in expression parsing because it eliminates the need for parentheses and operator precedence rules, making evaluation straightforward for machines.

---

### 🧠 Core Concepts
1️⃣ Stack Data Structure
- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- Key operations:
    - Push – Insert an element into the stack
    - Pop – Remove the top element from the stack
- Stacks play a crucial role in expression evaluation by temporarily storing operands until operators are applied.

2️⃣ Prefix Expression
- In a prefix expression:
    - Operators come before operands
    - Evaluation is naturally performed from right to left
- Example:
    - Infix: 3 + 4
    - Prefix: +34

3️⃣ Reversal Technique
- Direct evaluation of prefix expressions is complex when scanning from left to right.
- To simplify:
    - The prefix expression is reversed
    - The reversed expression is then evaluated similarly to a postfix expression
- This approach allows efficient processing using a stack.

---

### ⚙️ Working Principle
- Read the prefix expression.
- Reverse the given expression.
- Initialize an empty stack.
- Scan the reversed expression from left to right.
- If the symbol is an operand, push it onto the stack.
- If the symbol is an operator:
    - Pop two operands from the stack.
    - Apply the operator in correct order.
    - Push the result back onto the stack.
- After complete evaluation, the stack contains a single value.
- This value represents the final result of the prefix expression.

    - Pop the next element as op2
    - Perform the operation op2 operator op1
    - Push the result onto the stack
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until end of expression
9. Pop final result
    - Pop the remaining value from the stack
10. Display the result
11. Stop

---

### 🚀 Applications

## Linear Queue Implementation Using Array

### 🎯 Objective

The objective of this program is to implement a Linear Queue using an array and demonstrate its fundamental operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and display. The program helps in understanding how queues work internally using array-based storage.

---

### 📘 Introduction

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
This means the element inserted first is removed first.

In a linear queue, elements are inserted from one end called the rear and deleted from the other end called the front. This implementation uses a fixed-size array to store queue elements.

---

### 🧠 Core Concepts
1️⃣ Queue Data Structure
- A queue maintains two important pointers:
    - Front – points to the first element
    - Rear – points to the last element
- Operations are performed based on these pointers.

2️⃣ FIFO Principle
- FIFO stands for First In, First Out:
    - The first element added to the queue will be the first one removed
    - This principle is commonly used in real-life scenarios like ticket counters and scheduling systems

3️⃣ Array Implementation
- In array-based queues:
    - Memory size is fixed
    - Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations
    - Queue overflow occurs when the array is full
    - Queue underflow occurs when the queue is empty

---

### ⚙️ Queue Operations
#### 🔹 Enqueue (Insertion)
- Adds an element at the rear end of the queue
- Checks for queue overflow
- Updates the rear pointer after insertion

#### 🔹 Dequeue (Deletion)
- Removes an element from the front end of the queue
- Checks for queue underflow
- Updates the front pointer after deletion
- Resets front and rear when the queue becomes empty

#### 🔹 Display
- Displays all elements present in the queue
- Traverses from front to rear
- Shows queue contents in FIFO order

---

### 🚀 Working Principle
- Initialize the queue with front and rear set to -1.
- Perform enqueue operation to insert elements at the rear.
- Perform dequeue operation to remove elements from the front.
- Display operation shows current elements of the queue.
- The program continues until the user chooses to exit.

- Print spooling
- Process management
- Data buffering
- Breadth First Search (BFS)

---

### 🏁 Conclusion

The array implementation of a linear queue provides a clear understanding of queue fundamentals and FIFO behavior. Although simple and efficient for small datasets, it suffers from memory limitations. This implementation serves as a foundational concept for advanced queue structures like circular queues, dequeues, and priority queues.
